# lap — token-efficiency scorer for agent-facing APIs

`lap` is the open, neutral, standalone toolkit (no pet-zoo dependency) that measures
how many **tokens** an API's definitions cost an LLM. It answers: *is my agent-API
menu efficient, and by how much could it shrink?* — an open, reproducible number to set
beside the fast-growing MCP/OpenAPI tooling (see [`../docs/LANDSCAPE.md`](../docs/LANDSCAPE.md)
for the neighbors LAP builds on and credits).

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .                  # from the repo root (or: pip install lap-score once published)
pip install -e ".[mcp]"           # + real-MCP baseline (fastmcp)
pip install -e ".[faithful]"      # + faithful Anthropic count_tokens
```

Core deps are just `httpx` + `tiktoken` + `pyyaml`; `fastmcp` and `anthropic` are optional extras.
Robust to real specs: `allOf`/`oneOf`/`anyOf`, `$ref` in params/requestBodies/responses,
path-item-level parameters, OpenAPI 3.1 `type` lists, external `$ref`s (left intact), YAML input,
**Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0** (response `schema`, `in: body` params, type-on-parameter, `#/definitions`),
and non-JSON media types (`*+json`, form, XML). Verified crash-free + non-degenerate across 175+
real APIs.guru specs — re-run with [`../experiments/fuzz_corpus.py`](../experiments/fuzz_corpus.py).

## Quickstart

```bash
lap score  https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json   # menu (bucket A) token cost
lap lint   https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json   # flag LAP rule violations
lap score  --mcp-url http://localhost:8080/mcp                # score a live MCP server's tools
lap score  lap/examples/bookstore.openapi.json

# no install needed, from the repo root:
python -m lap.score lap/examples/bookstore.openapi.json
```

Example output:

```
LAP menu score - Bookstore API
operations: 6   referenced component schemas: 2

  variant       A tokens  saved vs full  form
  openapi_full  418       +0%            6 tool(s)
  compact_sig   205       +51%           manifest text
  numbered      168       +60%           manifest text

Menu efficiency: compact signatures are +51% vs naive OpenAPI->tools (418 -> 205 tokens).
```

When `fastmcp` is installed, the score also includes a **real-MCP baseline**
(`FastMCP.from_openapi`) — what an actual MCP generator emits — plus its
output-schema-inclusive figure (`--no-mcp` to skip). On a real public API
(**Swagger Petstore**, 19 ops) the real MCP server costs **2226** menu tokens
(**3844** with output schemas) vs **415** for compact signatures — an ~81%
reduction. The toy finding holds in the wild: a real MCP generator is *heavier*
than the naive baseline.

The score also includes a lazy **`tool_search`** form (the Anthropic Tool Search /
Cloudflare Code Mode pattern: a fixed 2-tool menu + a name index, schemas loaded on
demand). Because it doesn't preload schemas, its bucket A is ~flat in the number of
operations — on a 120-operation API it collapses the menu ~83% vs full schemas,
beating even compact signatures at scale (Petstore: 1740 → 207, −88%).

- **Faithful counts:** set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (uses the free Anthropic `count_tokens`
  endpoint; tool defs counted via the real `tools=` parameter). Without it, a GPT-style
  `tiktoken` approximation — absolute numbers approximate, **relative ordering robust**.

## Score your installed MCP stack

`lap stack` answers the 2026 headline question — *"how many tokens does my agent pay before I
type a word?"* — for **your** machine. It reads the agent's own MCP config (Claude Code project
`.mcp.json`, Claude Code `~/.claude.json`, Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`, or any
JSON with an `mcpServers` map), connects to every server it lists (stdio or HTTP), and totals
the advertised tool menus:

```bash
lap stack                        # auto-discover Claude Code / Claude Desktop configs
lap stack path/to/mcp.json       # or score an explicit config
lap stack --only github,jira     # subset; --json for machine-readable; --timeout N per server
```

```
LAP stack scan - tokenizer: tiktoken-approx

demo-mcp-config.json
  server        kind   tools  menu tokens  compact  note
  time          stdio      2          283       31
  git           stdio     12         1418      153
  needs-node    stdio      -            -        -  RuntimeError: Client failed to connect: ...
  TOTAL                    14         1701      184

Your agent pays ~1,701 tokens of tool menus at session start - before you type a word
(14 tools across 2 reachable server(s)).
Compact signatures of the same tools would cost 184 (+89% saved); one lazy tool_search menu
over the whole stack, 193 (+89% saved).
```

Unreachable servers (missing binary, no credentials) become annotated rows, not crashes. The
stack-level `tool_search` what-if is counted honestly: the fixed search/call tools are paid
**once** for the whole stack, plus a name index across all servers. Needs the `[mcp]` extra.

## Diff mode

`lap score --diff <before> <after>` compares two versions of a spec instead of scoring one —
"did this PR make the API worse for agents?" Reports the menu token delta per form, plus which
LAP lint findings were newly introduced or fixed:

```bash
lap score --diff old_openapi.json new_openapi.json
lap score --diff old_openapi.json new_openapi.json --gate-form compact_sig --max-growth 500
```

## CI gate

`--json` makes both commands machine-readable; thresholds set the exit code so LAP can fail a build:

```bash
lap score openapi.json --gate-form compact_sig --max-menu-tokens 800   # exit 1 if the menu is too heavy
lap score --diff old.json new.json --gate-form compact_sig --max-growth 500  # exit 1 if the menu grew too much
lap lint  openapi.json --fail-on warn                                  # exit 1 on any warning
lap lint  openapi.json --ignore R2,A1                                  # suppress rules (or a ./.lapignore file)
```

GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- run: pip install lap-score          # or: pip install -e .
- run: lap score api/openapi.json --gate-form compact_sig --max-menu-tokens 800
- run: lap lint  api/openapi.json --fail-on warn
```

…or the bundled composite **Action** (one step, no manual install):

```yaml
- uses: lCrazyblindl/lap@v0.3.0
  with:
    spec: api/openapi.json
    max-menu-tokens: "800"     # gate the compact_sig menu (omit = report only)
    fail-on: warn              # fail on any lint warning (omit = report only)
```

Already lint OpenAPI with **Spectral**? The same LAP rules ship as a ruleset —
see [`../spectral/`](../spectral/README.md).

## What it measures (and what it doesn't)

It measures **bucket A** (the definitions/menu the model carries in context) and **estimates
C** (result size, from each response schema + an assumed `--page-size` — a structural lower
bound that captures keys/nesting/types). **B** (the call) still depends on per-API tasks; for a
full measured A/B/C run see
[`../experiments/token-bench`](../experiments/token-bench/README.md). The conventions
behind the compact form are the [LAP profile](../profile/llm-api-profile.md).
