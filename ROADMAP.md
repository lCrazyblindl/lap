# LAP Roadmap — token-efficiency layer for the agentic web

**What this is:** the staged plan for **LAP**, an open, neutral toolkit that measures
the token cost of agent-facing APIs (A/B/C buckets) and scores them against the LAP
profile. Positioned as the **efficiency-measurement + guidance layer** the ecosystem
lacks — complementary to MCP/NLWeb, **not** a rebuild of gateways/auth/discovery
(those are already covered by Microsoft NLWeb, AWS/Hypr MCP gateways, NIST/IETF auth).

**How to resume (future sessions):** read this file, find the **▶** stage, do it, tick
it `[x]`, move **▶** to the next stage, and update the `lap-roadmap` memory pointer.
Load only the files that stage needs — the user has a limited token budget, so this is
built for stop/resume, one bounded session per stage.

## Reuse (don't rebuild)

`experiments/token-bench/`: `spec_source.py` (the `Op` IR, `list_operations`,
`inline_refs`), `tokens.py` (count backends), `variants/*`
(openapi_full / compact_sig / numbered / code_exec / odata_query / mcp_fastmcp),
`query_engine.py`, `sandbox.py` + `sandbox_runner.py`, `run_bench.py`;
`profile/llm-api-profile.md` (the LAP profile draft). Run with `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe`.

## Stages

- [x] **Stage 0 — Persist the plan.** `ROADMAP.md` + `lap-roadmap` memory pointer +
  repo `CLAUDE.md` link. _Done: a new session resumes from the pointer alone._
- [x] **Stage 1 — Landscape & positioning** → [`docs/LANDSCAPE.md`](docs/LANDSCAPE.md).
  Done: June-2026 landscape (NLWeb, llms.txt, MCP gateways, NIST/IETF auth, efficiency
  patterns) mapped with sources; LAP positioned as the efficiency-measurement niche.
- [ ] **▶ Stage 2 — Generalize the scorer beyond pet-zoo.** Accept ANY OpenAPI
  (file/URL), reusing `spec_source` normalization + the variant generators. CLI
  `lap score <openapi>` → A/B/C table + LAP level. _Verify: scores a non-pet-zoo OpenAPI._
- [ ] **Stage 3 — Score real ecosystem targets.** A real MCP server (FastMCP from a
  public OpenAPI) and, if feasible, an NLWeb `/mcp` endpoint. _Verify: ≥1 real API
  scored end to end._
- [ ] **Stage 4 — Faithful tokens + success check.** Default to Anthropic
  `count_tokens` when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set; run `--live` for pass/fail.
  _Verify: a task set has faithful token + success numbers._
- [ ] **Stage 5 — LAP profile v1.0 + linter.** Promote `profile/llm-api-profile.md`
  to v1 (measured guidance for MCP/NLWeb/OpenAPI authors); add `lap lint` checking
  L1–L4 with measured citations. _Verify: lint flags real violations._
- [ ] **Stage 6 — Package & share.** Quickstart, examples, PyPI/GitHub release, short
  writeup. _Verify: a stranger can `pip install` and score their API._

## Status

**▶ Next: Stage 2** (Generalize the scorer beyond pet-zoo). Stages 0–1 done.
